<details><summary>전체 스크립트</summary>
- Year after year,

more of us are quietly
asking the internet,

why am I so tired?

Searching for answers
to something we all feel

but don't really understand.

Every morning we're waking up

feeling a little bit more worn out

than we were the day before.

Our afternoon slumps
are a little slumpier.

So much so that companies
make fun of us for this.

(bright music)
(elevator dings)

- What's going on?

- It's a 3:00 PM slump.

- Selling us meat or cheese or coffee

or human grade jet fuel

to somehow cure our
afternoon energy deficit.

Now, listen, this isn't a
video where I'm gonna tell you

to just get more sleep or to
stop looking at your phone

before bed, which all of
those things you should do,

but I wanna approach this
question a little differently.

I wanna look at the bigger
reasons why we're all so tired.

A lot of those reasons have to do

with what's happening
right now during the day.

Like right now, while I'm filming this,

things are happening in my brain

and your brain that will make
us more tired later on today

and tomorrow.

It'll affect how long
and how well you sleep

and whether or not you feel
refreshed in the morning.

(soft music)

In order to understand
why you're so tired,

I'm gonna take you back in
time to 300,000 years ago.

(clock ticking)

Meet Johnny Caveman.

Johnny Caveman kind of has a
similar body to ours today.

He's a human. His body's
a little different.

His hips and his head are
shaped a little differently.

He's got this wider, flatter nose.

He's got this big, strong
brow, but up where it counts,

his brain is very similar
to our brain today,

and yet how he uses his
brain is very different,

similar brains, totally different worlds.

To show this,

let me show you Johnny
Caveman's morning routine.

(bright music)

As Johnny Caveman begins his day,

let's keep an eye on
this part of his brain.

This is the prefrontal cortex.

When you make decisions,

this part of your brain
is doing most of the work.

This morning, Johnny Caveman
has a few decisions to make.

He has to decide where
to get his water today.

Should he go out and hunt with his group

or should he spend time picking berries?

He just found some mushrooms.
Are these mushrooms safe?

Should he eat them?

Johnny Caveman will likely
spend a big chunk of his day

just sitting here around
this campsite eating

and chatting with his
band of other humans.

He might go out and gather
sticks to build a campfire later.

I mean, look at his brain.

There's some decisions being made here,

but it isn't pinging very much.

There's not a ton of action up here

in the prefrontal cortex.

His day is routine with
not a ton of choices,

fairly simple decisions, okay,

but let's transport forward in time now.

I wonder what would happen

if we put this same Johnny
Caveman in the 20th century.

Same brain, same body, different world.

(bright music)

Ah, yawn.

The sun is still waking Johnny Caveman up

and now he's got a few decisions to make.

He decides to shave
before he goes to work.

What's for breakfast? Apples again?

I think I'll have a peach.

Now off to work.

The world's gone through
the industrial revolution,

so he spends his day at a factory

where he's repeating tasks over and over.

He's definitely making more decisions

than Johnny Caveman was.

But the prefrontal cortex
isn't pinging a ton.

It's not a lot of action up here.

Okay, how does Johnny Caveman do in 2024?

- [Brain] Did I get
enough sleep last night?

Where's my phone?

Is my kid's concert today or tomorrow?

Oh, I need new socks.

These don't match.

What should I eat for lunch later?

Should I cancel with my coworker?

Did I have a burrito yesterday?

I need to remember to send the receipts

to the insurance company.

I need to file that expense report.

What am I gonna change to this fish?

How much gas is in my car?

Should I get a oil change this week?

Should I be upgrading to a different?

It's 8:30 in the morning

and I've already made a ton of decisions,

way more than Johnny Caveman

or the Johnny from the 20th century.

These decisions are complex.

They are abstract, they're high stakes.

My prefrontal cortex is going bananas.

One estimate I read said

that modern humans make
35,000 decisions every day.

We make more than 200
decisions about food alone.

Okay, okay, I get it.

Modern life is full of a lot of decisions,

but like, I'm not running
from tigers anymore.

Like I don't have to like
scavenge and hunt for my food.

Shouldn't I be less tired?

I'm using my brain instead of my body

and I'm doing way less physical work.

I mean, we've got washing
machines and dishwashers

and automatic head
massagers and at-home spas,

and damn it, we even have La-Z-Boys.

Shouldn't I feel more rested
because of all of this?

Okay, and here's where
we come to the answer

to the question, which is we gotta look at

that prefrontal cortex again

and see what's actually going on

when you make all of these decisions.

It's a part of a war

that is happening between
you and the modern world.

This war is being fought on
two different battlefields,

daytime and nighttime.

♪ Day man ♪

♪ Aha ♪

♪ Fighter of the night man ♪

♪ Aha ♪

♪ Champion of the sun ♪

So we're in this daytime battlefield

and you're making a bunch of decisions.

We've talked about that.

Let's see what's happening
here in the brain.

When you're making decisions,

there's an electronic
signal, like a pulse,

that is traveling between
regions of the brain

along these wires called neurons.

You've got like almost a
hundred billion of these things

and they all are forming
this giant network,

tons of connections,

and they all send signals to each other.

That is what decisions and actions are.

But in order to send these signals

between the different parts of the brain,

you need a very important
chemical called glutamate.

Glutamate makes all of this happen.

It's a neurotransmitter.

It helps everything talk to each other.

But look, after you make the decision,

the glutamate kind of sticks around,

and as you make more and more decisions,

glutamate starts to build up

and it starts to clog the system,

which new research suggests
makes decisions harder

because the whole system is clogged,

which makes you feel fatigued.

Make a bunch of decisions,

you feel tired even if
you didn't lift a finger.

It's like as if your
brain were a big city.

All of these roads are the neurons

and synapses that you
use to make decisions.

It's all functioning nicely.

Everyone can flow,

but the more decisions you
make, the more trash you produce

and the trash starts to pile up.

Trash collectors will
eventually move this trash out,

but if you're producing a ton
of trash, it starts to pile up

and it eventually starts

to block the streets making it much harder

for the cars to move along.

Meaning for your brain activity to do

what it's supposed to do
for you to make decisions.

This is what it looks like
when you're really tired.

It's 11:30 AM here at my desk

and I've made so many decisions.

I haven't done any strenuous work,

but I'm drowning in
glutamate and feeling tired.

By the way, this is
like brand new research

from the Paris Brain Institute

and it is still being worked out

how this works or exactly
what it looks like.

You can check my sources

to fact check everything
I say in this video,

but look at this paper specifically,

it's pretty interesting.

So I'm gonna jot this down on
my list of why we're so tired.

I'll be making this list

and this solutions on
what we can do about it.

A lot of cultures have a solve for this.

It's called biphasic sleep,

which is just a cool sounding name

for a nap in the afternoon.

People usually around like
the Mediterranean take naps

from the hours of like two to five.

They rest, they reset.

Research found that
people who take siestas

have increased brain functioning
and are 37% less likely

to die of heart disease.

But here in the United States,

we pledge to not sleep on the job.

We will never take naps

like those failing socialist
countries in the Mediterranean.

No, the hustle never
stops here in America.

Sorry, I recently watched Top Gun.

I'm just feeling really
patriotic right now.

- That's right. I am dangerous.

- So our brains, which are the same

as Johnny Caveman's brains,

aren't totally set up to
make all of these decisions

without feeling very tired.

I mean, it kind of makes sense.

We've got these caveman
brains living in 2024.

This is called evolutionary mismatch.

Our brains haven't caught
up with our lifestyle,

with our world and all of the
decisions that we are required

to make to just be normal, modern humans.

So what do we do about this?

(pensive music)

Well, you can take siestas, which is like,

it's not something I can do in my life.

I'm just not set up for
it here, sorry guys.

But that would be a way

to clear out some glutamate and reset.

But the biggest takeaway
for me is just limit

how many decisions I
have to make every day,

which is not easy, but there
definitely are ways to do it.

I've started choosing the
outfits that I'm gonna wear

for the week on Sunday

so that in the morning when
I wake up, I'm just like, oh,

the outfit's already chosen.

Or you could go full Steve
Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg style

and just wear one thing so
that you can have a closet

that looks like this, which.

Meal planning, that's another one.

On a Sunday, we've started
like writing down every meal

we're gonna have during the week,

and that makes life way easier

when you're at the end of a day of work

and you are feeling tired.

(pensive music)

A big theme in today's
video is information.

How much information our
brain are met with these days.

And even as a journalist, it's my job

and I get stressed out by the amount

of information out there.

One of the tools we
use to sift through all

of this is actually the
sponsor of today's video,

Ground News is a website

and an app that takes news
stories from all around the world

and aggregates them into one place

and then gives you a ton of
information about that story

and its sources.

Instead of an algorithm,

you are in control with Ground News.

This tool allows you to see

what political bias exists
in the different articles,

how reliable each source is,

who owns these different
publications, a whole other level

of transparency that allows you

to feel confident in
the news you're reading.

One of my favorite parts about
Ground News is it helps you

keep an eye on your own reading habits.

It gives you this dashboard

where it shows you some
insights, like the top sources

that you rely on and
how reliable they are.

And my favorite of these
insights, the Blindspot Feed.

When you're navigating so
much information, it's hard

to remember that sometimes you are

in a very different news
bubble than everyone else.

The BlinsSpot Feed helps you see this

by giving you articles that
you wouldn't naturally click on

or be exposed to helping you
fill in your perspective,

challenge your biases.

I value this kind of thing
so much as a critical thinker

and as someone who is
worried about echo chambers

and bias in today's news landscape.

So if you are tired of
letting social media companies

and sensational headlines
decide what you click,

Ground News might be for you.

It's a great way to sharpen
your critical thinking skills

and to stay informed while doing it.

If you wanna try this out,
you can get a big discount

if you click the link in my description,

it's ground.news/johnnyharris.

You can also use this QR code on screen

if that's more convenient.

This will allow you to get
40% off the Vantage Plan,

which is all of these tools
I've talked about today.

So thank you Ground News for
sponsoring today's video.

With that, let's dive back
in to why we are so tired.

There's one more chemical
we have to talk about

for this daytime battle
and it's called adenosine.

It is this very clever
evolutionary feature of our brain.

It's basically like a
signal to our brains.

It tells us when it's time to rest.

As you go throughout your day thinking

and doing things, this adenosine builds up

and it kind of signals to
your brain that you're tired.

It signals that you should feel sleepy

and hopefully makes you go to sleep.

But being industrious
humans focused on progress,

we found a substance

that will block the buildup of adenosine.

It's called caffeine,

making caffeine the most
popular drug in the world.

It blocks adenosine, this natural signal

of you should be tired and sleep

and allows us to keep operating

as if the adenosine doesn't exist.

But guess what? The caffeine
doesn't last forever.

It eventually wears out

and all of this adenosine

that had built up comes
flooding into your brain

like a megaphone saying,
hey, you're really tired

and we're finally able to tell you.

This is called the afternoon crash.

My solution to this is like
the greatest thing in the world

and it's called a coffee nap.

When you nap, your body
gets rid of the adenosine.

It's like the adenosine clearing hour,

and if you drink caffeine,

then you get this like multiplier effect

where all the adenosine is gone

and the caffeine just comes in.

It doesn't have to block any adenosine

and it's just ready to like hype you up.

Drink a quick coffee, lay down

for just 15 minutes, it's amazing.

Coffee naps, add it to the list.

The other option is to drink
your coffee a little bit

like later than you would.

Like don't drink it right as you wake up.

Drink it between the hours of nine

and 11:00 AM so that it lasts
until you're done with work

and then you can have your coffee crash.

Okay, so that is our daytime battle.

Glutamate builds up because
we make so many decisions.

Adenosine builds up because
we don't let it clear out

and we block the signals
because of caffeine,

and our modern world doesn't like us

naturally clearing these things out,

so we feel really tired.

Now let's get to the nighttime battle.

(soft music)

Everyone says we should get
seven or eight hours of sleep,

but when you go to bed

and when I go to bed
is probably different.

Back in the Johnny Caveman days, groups

of humans couldn't leave their
camp unattended at night.

So we evolved to have different
sleep times so that some

of us could stay awake and guard the camp

and others could sleep and
then we could switch off.

Today, what that looks like
is that I go to bed at 10:30

and I wake up at 6:30.

You may be a night owl

and you want to go to bed
at one in the morning,

or you may want to go to bed at 9:00 AM.

These are called the chronotypes

and there are roughly four of them.

Everyone has a slightly
different interpretation

of what it means,

but the fact is, we're not all the same

when it comes to when we go to bed,

and yet we all live in a society

that wants us to be the same.

Our standard workday, nine
to five, was constructed

for like the average person,
but you may not be that person.

You have a job that requires
you to be there at 9:00 AM

and you are a night owl who
wants to sleep until 10:30?

Too bad.

Capitalism says no.

Researchers say that our
chronotype is in our genes.

Like this is like, we are naturally coded

to have an optimal time
when we are sleeping,

and that may not work with your life.

Evolutionary mismatch once again.

So I'm gonna write
chronotypes down on my list.

What's the solution here? Find
out what your chronotype is.

You probably already know what it is.

Take this test online.

I'll give you a QR code
here. You can scan this.

Take a test.

Maybe aligning your lifestyle
with your chronotype

could help you get sleep during the time

when your sleep is most optimal,

which will help make you feel less tired.

(soft music)

Okay, finally, in a video

that you clicked on about
why you're so tired,

finally, we're talking about sleep.

Sleep definitely matters,

and I think there's actually
a lot of great videos

and literature, books, whatever on sleep

and how to optimize sleep.

Our brains catalog all these memories,

all the sensory input

and memories from the day get cataloged.

Our muscles and our circulatory
system, they all get

to relax and take a break,
which is super vital.

And as we talked about
earlier, we clear out a lot

of like the byproducts from
living life, the glutamate,

the adenosine, all of the kind of toxins

and byproducts that we
accumulate from a day.

This is all super important,

but not all sleep is created equal,

and what we do in the hours leading up

to bed can make a big difference.

So let's see what this
looks like using an example.

As we're following along,
let's track my chemical levels.

I get home around 8:00 PM.

I whip up some of my
famous macaroni and cheese

before sitting down to my desk

because I've got a little more work to do.

Now my chronotype is the lion,

which means I kind of want
to go to bed like at 10.

I'm getting kind of tired, so
I pour myself a cup of coffee

to fight off all the adenosine

that has been building up in my brain.

Okay, I finish up my work.

It's two hours past when
I'd normally go to bed,

but I need some time to wind down.

Here I am making more decisions on Netflix

and look, even though
it's nighttime outside,

this giant TV screen is emitting light.

My brain thinks this is the
sun. It thinks it's daytime.

So it blocks the release of melatonin.

Melatonin's a chemical that we need

to shift our brain from
wakefulness to sleep.

Finally, after some Netflix,
I feel like I've wound down

and I'm gonna go to bed.

It's 2:00 AM.

I turn off the TV and I get
a little bit of melatonin,

but not nearly enough to feel tired.

I've got a ton of adenosine in my brain,

but it's not registering.

I should be feeling tired,

but all of this adenosine is blocked

by the caffeine I had earlier.

One more look at my phone to set my alarm.

Gotta check Instagram really quick.

Eventually the caffeine wears off.

The adenosine comes flooding
in and I fall right asleep,

but it's now 3:00 AM.

My body goes through the important process

of clearing out all these chemicals.

It's a slow process.

I need time to do this.

My body's making great progress and then.

(alarm rings)

It's been five hours,

which is just not enough
time for our bodies

to take out all the trash.

My brain still kinda looks like this.

I'm gonna start my day with all

of the residual glutamate
chemicals swirling

around in my brain as I
start to make new decisions

and accumulate more
glutamate, more adenosine

that I'm gonna block with caffeine.

So I guess I'm gonna add
the obvious one to my list.

Get enough sleep

and wind down without caffeine

or alcohol, the things that kind

of kill your ability to get good sleep.

Now let me just say there's
a lot more to say on sleep.

It's very well documented.

There's a lot of like pop
science books about sleep.

I didn't want to go into those now

because I feel like
they're easily accessible,

but you should definitely
check out my sources

if you want to learn more
about preparing for good sleep

and having good sleep and why it matters.

(bright music)

So this is my list.

Here it is.

Why we're so tired and
what we can do about it.

It's not exhaustive.

(bell dinging)

But it includes the lesser covered aspects

of fatigue that I have
found very compelling

and that have affected how I
approach my day-to-day life.

In short, it's not just
because we look at our phones

before bed that we're so tired,
there's a lot more going on,

and a lot of it has to
do with life, modern life

and these brains that we
have that were evolved

for a very different time.

There's a lot of upside to the fact

that we don't live in caves next

to campfires hunting for our food.

But one of the downsides is

that we feel this very
specific kind of fatigue.

It's often mental fatigue,

and now I understand why.

I'm not gonna dramatically change my life

because of these findings,

but I now at least have
a list of a few things

that I can tweak to maybe
feel a little less tired.

Hey everyone, thanks for watching.

I had a question for
anyone still watching.

Would you be interested in
buying some of my old maps?

I've got like hundreds of maps

that I've collected over the years

and I am thinking about
opening a map store.

I could scan them and sell
prints on really nice paper

or I could sell you the
originals or I could do both.

Let me know what you think.

This is like an early
idea and I'm just curious.

I wanna hear from you all.

Most people have left by now,
and so it's just a few of you.

So just like leave a comment
if you have heard this

and let me know.

I also wanted to make sure

that everyone knows about our new channel

called Search Party, not so new.

It's about a year old now,

but it is started by my
old colleague, Sam Ellis.

It is a focus on geopolitics
and global sports.

It's a fantastic channel,
very concise, beautiful videos

that I learned a lot from, and
you should go check it out.

Thanks so much for watching.
I'll see you in the next one.

   # 크로노타입(생체시계 유형) 분석

## 1. 크로노타입의 개념

### 원문:
```
Back in the Johnny Caveman days, groups of humans couldn't leave their camp unattended at night. So we evolved to have different sleep times so that some of us could stay awake and guard the camp and others could sleep and then we could switch off.
```
- 역사적 배경:
  - "Back in the Johnny Caveman days" - 원시 시대를 친근하게 표현
  - "couldn't leave their camp unattended" - 무방비 상태로 둘 수 없었다
- 진화적 설명:
  - "evolved to have" - 진화하게 되었다
  - "switch off" - 교대하다

## 2. 현대의 크로노타입

### 원문:
```
Today, what that looks like is that I go to bed at 10:30 and I wake up at 6:30. You may be a night owl and you want to go to bed at one in the morning, or you may want to go to bed at 9:00 AM.
```
- 시간 표현:
  - "go to bed at" - ~시에 취침하다
  - "wake up at" - ~시에 기상하다

```
- 사회적 구조:
  - 9-5 근무 시간
  - 표준화된 일과
- 개인과의 충돌:
  - 개인의 생체리듬 무시
  - 사회적 요구와의 불일치

## 5. 과학적 근거
