## Writing Practice
### Writing Practice Questions
1. What do you think about the confrontation between CIO and PSS?
2. How might this incident affect the political situation?
3. What could have been done differently to avoid this situation?
4. What might happen next in this case?
5. How would you handle such a sensitive situation?

### Writing Prompt
What do you think about the confrontation between CIO and PSS?

### Your Submission
The CIO is a special investigation team for high-ranking officers, especially elected officials. In this case, the CIO had to investigate the impeached president, Mr. Yoon. However, Mr. Yoon did not respond to the investigation and claimed it was not legal. The investigation and arrest warrant were based on law. He made false claims and instigated extreme right-wing supporters, which was very irresponsible behavior, especially as he was still in a presidential position even though suspended.

### Evaluation and Corrections
#### 1. 문법적 정확성
- 시제 일치
  - "CIO have to" → "CIO had to" (과거 사건이므로 과거시제 필요)
  - "claims" → "claimed" (과거 사건과의 일관성)
  - "make" → "made" (과거 시제 필요)
  
- 관사 사용
  - "CIO is special" → "The CIO is a special"
  - "investigation and arrest warrant" → "The investigation and arrest warrant"
  
- 전치사 사용
  - "response the investigation" → "respond to the investigation"
  - "form law" → "based on law"
  
- 주어-동사 일치
  - "CIO have" → "CIO has" (CIO는 단수 취급)

#### 2. 문장 구조
- 완전한 문장 구성
  - "That is very irresponseble behavior" → 앞 문장과 연결하여 "which was very irresponsible behavior"
  
- 접속사 사용
  - "But" → "However" (더 형식적인 문어체)
  - "especially hehe is" → "especially as he was"

#### 3. 어휘 사용
- 철자 오류
  - "imprechmented" → "impeached"
  - "extreame" → "extreme"
  - "irresponseble" → "irresponsible"
  - "hehe" → "he"
  
- 단어 선택
  - "high officer" → "high-ranking officers"
  - "people who extreame right wing" → "extreme right-wing supporters"

#### 4. 내용 구성
- 논리적 흐름
  - 전반적으로 시간순서대로 잘 구성됨
  - 사건의 원인과 결과가 명확히 제시됨
  
- 문장 간 연결
  - 접속사와 전환어 추가로 더 자연스러운 연결 필요
  
- 결론의 완성도
  - 마지막 문장에서 현 상황의 심각성을 잘 강조함

#### 5. 개선을 위한 구체적 제안
##### 수정된 최종 버전
The CIO is a special investigation team for high-ranking officers, especially elected officials. In this case, the CIO had to investigate the impeached president, Mr. Yoon. However, Mr. Yoon did not respond to the investigation and claimed it was not legal. The investigation and arrest warrant were based on law. He made false claims and instigated extreme right-wing supporters, which was very irresponsible behavior, especially as he was still in a presidential position even though suspended.

##### 추가 표현 제안
- "launch an investigation into" (수사를 시작하다)
- "refuse to comply with" (따르기를 거부하다)
- "question the legality of" (적법성에 의문을 제기하다)
- "act in accordance with" (~에 따라 행동하다)

### Second Writing Practice
### Your Submission
It is very difficult phase. The CIO's investigation was in accoring with legal procedure. But the President, he was former prosecutor, refuse to comply with legal procedure. Also he question the legality and said "exteamly right people will still fight for me". The investigation will be more harder and South Korean will be more fragmented.

### Evaluation and Corrections
#### 1. 문법적 정확성
- 관사 사용
  - "a very difficult phase"
  - "a former prosecutor"
  
- 시제 일치
  - "refuse" → "refused"
  - "question" → "questioned"
  
- 비교급 형태
  - "more harder" → "harder"
  - "more fragmented" → "further fragmented"

#### 2. 문장 구조
- 주어-동사 일치
- 불필요한 대명사 제거
- 접속사 사용 개선

  - "phase" → "situation"
  - "South Korean" → "South Korean society"

#### 수정된 버전
This is a very difficult situation. The CIO's investigation was in accordance with legal procedures. The President, a former prosecutor, refused to comply with legal procedures. Furthermore, he questioned the legality and said "extremely right-wing supporters will still fight for me". The investigation will become harder and South Korean society will be further fragmented.

#### 개선을 위한 추가 표현 제안
- "heighten political tensions" (정치적 긴장을 고조시키다)
- "deepen social divisions" (사회적 분열을 심화시키다)
- "undermine democratic principles" (민주주의 원칙을 훼손하다)
- "escalate the conflict" (갈등을 고조시키다)

### Third Writing Practice
### Your Submission
In my opinion, we've been failing for a long time. Politics has become more judicially oriented, which means there is no room for dialogue. Everything has been reduced to a simple matter of true or false. Now, there is a conflict between the CIO's legal authority and the president's interpretation of the law. This is not how politics should work - we need to restore political dialogue, which is what true democracy means.

### Evaluation and Corrections
#### 1. 문법적 정확성
- 시제와 동사 형태
  - "Politics be" → "Politics has become"
  - "are fight" → "are fighting"
  - "We recover" → "We need to recover"

- 관사 사용
  - "The Politics" → "Politics"
  - "not politic" → "not politics"

  - "That is democracy" → "That is what democracy means"

#### 2. 문장 구조
- 불완전한 문장을 완전한 문장으로 수정
- 논리적 연결을 위한 접속사 추가
- 간단한 문장들을 더 복잡한 구조로 발전

#### 3. 어휘 사용
- 더 정확한 단어 선택
  - "judicialized" → "judicially oriented"
  - "conversation" → "dialogue"
  - "recover politic" → "restore political dialogue"

#### 수정된 버전
In my opinion, we've been failing for a long time. Politics has become more judicially oriented, which means there is no room for dialogue. Everything has been reduced to a simple matter of true or false. Now, there is a conflict between the CIO's legal authority and the president's interpretation of the law. This is not how politics should work - we need to restore political dialogue, which is what true democracy means.

#### 개선을 위한 추가 표현 제안
- "restore political dialogue" (정치적 대화를 회복하다)
- "find common ground" (공통분모를 찾다)
- "bridge the divide" (분열을 해소하다)
- "seek compromise" (타협점을 찾다)
- "promote mutual understanding" (상호 이해를 증진하다)

### Fourth Writing Practice
### Your Submission
I don't know what will happen next. It is not english problem, it is new phase of South Korean democracy. Indeed, we can bridge the divide and seek compromise? I don't know. I am negative position. I think it's easy for things to become even further fragmented.

### Evaluation and Corrections
#### 1. 문법적 정확성
- 관사 사용
  - "not english problem" → "not an English problem"
  - "new phase" → "a new phase"

- 문장 구조
  - "I am negative position" → "I take a negative position"
  - "Indeed, we can..." → "Can we really..."

- 구두점
  - 의문문의 올바른 형식 사용

#### 2. 문장 구조
- 불필요한 반복 제거 ("I don't know" 두 번 사용)
- 더 복잡한 문장 구조로 발전
- 접속사를 사용한 자연스러운 연결

#### 3. 어휘 사용
- 더 정확하고 풍부한 표현 선택
- 형식적인 어조 유지

#### 수정된 버전
I cannot predict what will happen next. This is not an English problem, but rather a new phase in South Korean democracy. Can we really bridge the divide and seek compromise in this situation? Taking a negative position, I believe it's more likely that society will become even further fragmented.

#### 개선을 위한 추가 표현 제안
- "predict the outcome" (결과를 예측하다)
- "take a stance" (입장을 취하다)
- "remain skeptical" (회의적인 입장을 유지하다)
- "foresee difficulties" (어려움을 예상하다)
- "anticipate further challenges" (추가적인 어려움을 예상하다)

### Fifth Writing Practice
### Your Submission
I argue that the CIO need to enforce the law more vigorously. Mr. Yoon is the enemy of democracy. We do not have to give a chance to him. Tolerance is very important value. But tolerance can stand without entolerance.

### Evaluation and Corrections
#### 1. 문법적 정확성
- 주어-동사 일치
  - "CIO need" → "CIO needs"
  
- 관사 사용
  - "very important value" → "a very important value"
  
- 철자 오류
  - "entolerance" → "intolerance"
  
- 문장 구조
  - "can stand without" → "cannot exist with"

#### 2. 문장 구조
- 더 형식적인 표현으로 개선
- 논리적 연결 강화
- 문장 간 자연스러운 흐름 개선

#### 3. 어휘 사용
- 더 적절한 단어 선택
- 형식적인 어조 유지
- 정확한 전문 용어 사용

#### 수정된 버전
I argue that the CIO needs to enforce the law more vigorously. Mr. Yoon's actions represent a threat to democratic principles. We should not compromise when it comes to protecting democratic values. While tolerance is a very important value in democracy, it cannot coexist with those who show intolerance towards democratic institutions.

#### 개선을 위한 추가 표현 제안
- "enforce the law" (법을 집행하다)
- "represent a threat to" (~에 대한 위협이 되다)
- "compromise on" (~에 대해 타협하다)
- "protect democratic values" (민주적 가치를 보호하다)
- "democratic institutions" (민주주의 제도)

### 우선적으로 개선해야 할 부분 💡
1. **문장 길이**
   - 어제: 매우 짧은 단문 위주
   - 오늘: 좀 더 긴 문장을 시도하고 있음 (예: "I think that human must have a sleep for 8 hours...")

2. **주제 접근**
   - 어제: 매우 단순한 설명 위주
   - 오늘: 자신의 의견과 이유를 설명하려 시도함 (예: 정치적 상황에 대한 분석 시도)

3. **어휘 시도**
   - 어제: 매우 기본적인 단어만 사용
   - 오늘: "enforce", "democracy", "legal procedure" 등 더 전문적인 단어 시도

### 문장 구조 발전 전략 📝
#### 문장 발전 단계 예시

1. **첫 단계: 기본 단문**
```
The CIO tried to arrest the president.
The PSS blocked them.
This caused a standoff.
```

2. **두 번째 단계: 접속사로 연결**
```
The CIO tried to arrest the president, but the PSS blocked them.
This caused a standoff.
```

3. **세 번째 단계: 관계사 등으로 정보 추가**
```
The CIO, which is a special investigation team, tried to arrest the president, but the PSS blocked them, which led to a five-hour standoff.
```

#### 권장하는 방법
1. 처음에는 짧고 명확한 문장으로 시작
2. 문법적 오류가 없는지 확인
3. 자신감이 생기면 접속사(and, but, so)로 연결
4. 더 익숙해지면 관계사(which, that, who)로 정보 추가

#### 하지 말아야 할 것
1. 처음부터 너무 긴 문장 시도
2. 불확실한 문법 구조 사용
3. 번역기로 긴 문장 그대로 번역

이런 단계적 접근을 통해 문법 오류를 줄이면서도 자연스럽게 더 복잡한 문장을 구사할 수 있습니다.
