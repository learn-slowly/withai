(Johnny sighing)

I just launched something really big.

It's live right now and I
wanna tell you about it.

(suspenseful music)

But first, I wanna explain why.

For the last four years,

we've brought you stories
from around the world.

(inquisitive music)

These stories have led us to Switzerland,

where I got to sleep in bunkers,

or Japan, where I got
to train with the army.

I've been able to source
old maps of Atlantis

and decode classified documents.

And of course, I got
the unique opportunity

to spend months investigating
McDonald's ice cream machines

and why they're always broken.

This channel has grown quickly,

thanks mostly to this
immensely talented team

that I get to work with.

And my partner is who leads that team.

And of course, all of you,

who show up week after week

looking to learn something new,

and to discuss and push us to be better

through critique and dialogue.

And yes, we will continue
to change thumbnails

as we see fit.

We make this show because we believe

in the unique experience of understanding,

and that that experience of understanding

doesn't come through constant streams

of updates and headlines

and alarming articles

trying to grab your attention.

Instead, we believe
that true understanding

comes through depth,

through nuance, rigor,

a look at history,

an acknowledgement of gray area,

good-faith debate.

We want to keep building a place

where that kind of journalism thrives.

Rigorous, accessible, visual journalism

that is led by creators.

This is the kind of
journalism that I love to make

and the kind of journalism
I like to watch.

Last year, we teamed up with Sam Ellis

to launch Search Party,

which helps you understand geopolitics

and global sports.

And today, I'm excited to announce

that we're doing it again,

teaming up with another
talented journalist

to launch a new channel.

- I'm gonna need some help to
explain this. (dynamic music)

- Christophe Haubursin

is one of the most talented
visual storytellers I know.

His journalism is driven
by an endless curiosity

and a desire to bring the
audience into his process,

not just telling us what he learned,

but showing us how he learned it.

And today, he is launching Tunnel Vision.

(suspenseful music)

Tunnel Vision is live right now.

And the first episode is
about the crypto scams

taking over WhatsApp.

And in it, you'll see
what I'm talking about.

The show will document
Christophe's journey

into uncovering mysteries

and answering questions

that he finds around the internet.

- I think this might be a
completely useless rabbit hole.

- And along the way,

Christophe will pull back the curtain

on the journalistic process,

emphasizing the journey of discovery,

instead of simply
presenting the final answer.

He'll introduce us to people that he meets

and show us places that maybe
we've never thought of before.

And like we've done with
Sam and Search Party,

we'll be appearing on
each other's channels,

helping each other out.

Whenever I have a burning question

that I think Christophe
can uniquely answer,

I'll be over there trying
to figure it out with him.

And I can't stop looking at it,

like it feels like I'm looking at

some like alien movie or something.

- Weird.

- There's gotta be an explanation here.

Let's see what the drone says.

(suspenseful music)

So the first episode is live right now.

I think we can put like
an info card on the screen

that pops out and you can click it

if you wanna just go watch it.

If this is the kinda stuff you're into,

make sure to subscribe.

And for those who wanna
stick around a little longer,

let me explain a bit more
on what we're building here.

Tunnel Vision is just one more step

in this direction that
we've been working towards

for a lot of years.

The coming together of
independent journalists

that are relatable and
earnest and curious,

that focus on the context

and the history and the backstory

of the events shaping our world.

All of you have helped me realize

that this is a missing piece

of today's media landscape,

and we want to be a part
of helping change that.

So we're not stopping
here with Tunnel Vision.

We are already in talks
with other journalists,

thinking about new channels,

how we're gonna grow this thing

to become a bigger and bigger collective

of creator-led journalism.

And we're calling it New Press.

We're literally building this right now.

Like, we're working on a logo,

we don't actually even have one.

So here's our current draft.

(light music)
(keys clacking)

And for those wondering,

this isn't gonna change anything
happening on this channel.

I'm gonna keep publishing in-depth videos.

The only difference is that
you're just gonna get more,

more creator-led journalism

from a growing number
of channels and shows

that we will continue
to develop and launch.

My vision here is that New Press

becomes the home of the
best visual journalism

on the internet,

from a growing number of creators

who are united by a
commitment to journalism

that is rigorous, yet accessible.

That is what we've been working on

and that is what we're going
to continue to work on.

And as always, I wanna
hear from all of you

to help shape the future of New Press.

I'm leaving a link in the description

that is to a survey

where you can leave your thoughts,

your questions, your feedback.

You can tell us what kind of channels

you wanna see in the future,

what kind of topics you
think we should be covering.

You have always influenced my work

and what I choose to cover,

and New Press will be no different.

So first, go watch Tunnel Vision,

see what Christophe's up to,

subscribe to the channel.

The more these channels grow,

the more videos we can make,

the better journalism we can do.

So we deeply appreciate your support.

Thank you all for being here.

And I'll see you in the next one.

- [Iz] Very, very soon.

(Johnny laughing)

(Iz laughing)

- I loved that.
